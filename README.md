# HashMap

A simple implementation of a HashMap data structure using JavaScript. Built for practice as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Full-Stack JavaScript curriculum.

This HashMap supports string keys and uses separate chaining to handle collisions. It automatically resizes when the load factor exceeds a threshold to maintain efficient performance.
